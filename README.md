# azure-log-analytics-data-collector Ruby Client

[Azure Log Analytics Data Collector API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/data-collector-api) Client Libraries for Ruby. The repository was originally created for multiple programming languages, but it was refactored as a dedicated one for Ruby client. Python and PHP client libraries were moved to [azure-log-analytics-data-colloector-python](https://github.com/yokawasa/azure-log-analytics-data-collector-python) and [azure-log-analytics-data-colloector-php](https://github.com/yokawasa/azure-log-analytics-data-collector-php) respectively.


## Installation
```bash
gem install azure-loganalytics-datacollector-api
```

## Sample code (Ruby Client)
### Sample1 - No time_generated_field option
```ruby
require "azure/loganalytics/datacollectorapi/client"

customer_id = '<Customer ID aka WorkspaceID String>'
shared_key = '<The primary or the secondary Connected Sources client authentication key>'
log_type = "MyCustomLog"

posting_records = []
record1= {
  :string => "MyText1",
  :boolean => true,
  :number => 100
}
record2= {
  :string => "MyText2",
  :boolean => false,
  :number => 200
}
posting_records.push(record1)
posting_records.push(record2)

client=Azure::Loganalytics::Datacollectorapi::Client::new( customer_id, shared_key)
res = client.post_data(log_type, posting_records)
puts res
puts "res code=#{res.code}"

if Azure::Loganalytics::Datacollectorapi::Client.is_success(res)
  puts "operation was succeeded!"
else
  puts "operation was failured!"
end
```

### Sample2 - With time_generated_field option
```ruby
require "azure/loganalytics/datacollectorapi/client"

customer_id = '<Customer ID aka WorkspaceID String>'
shared_key = '<The primary or the secondary Connected Sources client authentication key>'
log_type = "MyCustomLog"

posting_records = []
record1= {
  :string => "MyText1",
  :boolean => true,
  :number => 100,
  :timegen => "2017-11-23T11:13:35.576Z" # YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
}
record2= {
  :string => "MyText2",
  :boolean => false,
  :number => 200,
  :timegen => "2017-11-23T12:13:35.576Z" # YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ
}
posting_records.push(record1)
posting_records.push(record2)

time_generated_field = "timegen"
client=Azure::Loganalytics::Datacollectorapi::Client::new( customer_id, shared_key)
res = client.post_data(log_type, posting_records, time_generated_field)
puts res
puts "res code=#{res.code}"

if Azure::Loganalytics::Datacollectorapi::Client.is_success(res)
  puts "operation was succeeded!"
else
  puts "operation was failured!"
end
```

### Sample3 - use proxy to access the API
```ruby
require "azure/loganalytics/datacollectorapi/client"

...
client=Azure::Loganalytics::Datacollectorapi::Client::new( customer_id, shared_key)
# client.set_proxy() # ENV['http_proxy'] is set by default 
client.set_proxy(your_proxy)
res = client.post_data(log_type, posting_records, time_generated_field)
puts res
...
```
